Dummy Agent for UPC_PyGame

This agent connects to the game server, sends control actions based on key presses,
and retrieves game state information relative to the agent's player.

Dependencies:
- pygame: Used for creating a graphical window and handling key events.
- requests: Used for making HTTP requests to the game API.
- sys: Used to exit the program on critical errors.
- json: Used for pretty-printing JSON responses.
